# VS-MUSIC ðŸŽµ

VS-MUSIC is a music streaming platform where users can browse, search, and manage music albums, songs, playlists, and artists. It also includes an admin panel for managing users, albums, songs, and artists.

This project, VS MUSIC, was created strictly for academic survival purposes.
In other words: my college asked for a small PHP + MySQL project to award some internal marks, so here it is.

You are free to look, fork, or laugh at the code â€” but please understand this was never meant to be a production-ready masterpiece.
